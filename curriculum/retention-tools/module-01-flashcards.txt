What problem led to the emergence of DevOps?
Organizational silos between Development (speed) and Operations (stability) caused slow, error-prone releases and finger-pointing

What are the Three Ways of DevOps?
1. Flow (smooth delivery, eliminate waste)
2. Feedback (fast detection and recovery)
3. Continuous Learning & Experimentation

What are the Three Pillars of DevOps?
1. People (culture, collaboration, shared goals)
2. Process (automation, measurement, improvement)
3. Technology (tools that enable people and process)

Define "Continuous Integration" (CI)
Developers merge code to shared repository multiple times per day; automated builds and tests run immediately to catch issues early

Define "Continuous Delivery" (CD)
Code is always in a deployable state; can release to production at any time with a button click (but manual approval)

Define "Continuous Deployment"
Every code change that passes automated tests is automatically deployed to production (no manual approval)

What are the 4 DORA metrics?
1. Deployment Frequency
2. Lead Time for Changes
3. Change Failure Rate
4. Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)

Define "Deployment Frequency"
How often code is deployed to production (Elite: On-demand/multiple per day; Low: Monthly to every 6 months)

Define "Lead Time for Changes"
Time from code commit to running in production (Elite: < 1 hour; Low: 1-6 months)

Define "Change Failure Rate"
Percentage of deployments that cause production failures requiring rollback or hotfix (Elite: 0-15%; Low: 46-60%)

Define "Mean Time to Recovery" (MTTR)
How quickly service is restored after a production incident (Elite: < 1 hour; Low: 1 week to 1 month)

What DORA level is this: Deploy weekly, 1-week lead time, 20% failures, 1-day MTTR?
HIGH performer (weekly deploys = High; 1-week lead time = High; 20% = High; 1-day MTTR = High)

What DORA level is this: Deploy quarterly, 3-month lead time, 45% failures, 1-week MTTR?
LOW performer (all metrics in LOW range)

Define "toil" in DevOps
Manual, repetitive work that provides no enduring value; should be automated (e.g., manual deployments, ticket-based provisioning)

Define "Lead Time" in software delivery
Total time from feature request (or code commit) to production deployment; includes process time + wait time

Define "Process Time"
Actual time spent working on a task (e.g., coding, testing, deploying)

Define "Wait Time"
Time spent waiting between process steps (e.g., waiting for code review, waiting for deployment window)

What is a "blameless post-mortem"?
After an incident, team analyzes what went wrong focusing on system/process failures, NOT blaming individuals; goal is learning and prevention

Name 3 types of waste (muda) in software delivery
1. Waiting (for approvals, reviews, deployment windows)
2. Defects (bugs, rework, rollbacks)
3. Overprocessing (unnecessary steps, manual work that should be automated)

What is the DevOps Infinity Loop (8 phases)?
Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor (and back to Plan)

What happens in the "Plan" phase?
Define requirements, prioritize features, create user stories, plan sprints

What happens in the "Code" phase?
Write code, commit to version control, collaborate via pull requests

What happens in the "Build" phase?
Compile code, run automated builds, create artifacts (containers, packages)

What happens in the "Test" phase?
Run automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end), security scans, code quality checks

What happens in the "Release" phase?
Prepare for deployment, create release notes, get approvals (if needed)

What happens in the "Deploy" phase?
Push code to production using automation (CI/CD pipelines)

What happens in the "Operate" phase?
Manage production environment, handle incidents, scale resources

What happens in the "Monitor" phase?
Collect metrics, logs, traces; detect issues; feed insights back to Plan phase

Calculate Lead Time: Dev=3 days, Code Review wait=2 days, QA=2 days, QA wait=5 days, Deployment wait=90 days. What's the lead time?
106 days total (3+2+2+5+90+other steps)

From the above, what's the efficiency ratio?
~8.5% (only 9 days of actual work out of 106 total days; 91.5% is waiting)

What ROI calculation shows value of DevOps transformation?
ROI = (Annual Savings - Investment) / Investment × 100
Example: ($822k savings - $290k investment) / $290k = 184% ROI

Why do elite performers have LOWER failure rates despite deploying MORE frequently?
Smaller batches = less risk per deployment; faster feedback = catch issues earlier; practice makes perfect; automation reduces human error

True or False: DevOps is primarily about tools like Docker and Kubernetes
FALSE - DevOps is primarily about culture and process; tools enable but don't create DevOps

True or False: Automation eliminates jobs
FALSE - Automation eliminates toil (boring work); frees people for higher-value work like innovation, architecture, problem-solving

True or False: You need to achieve Elite DORA performance immediately
FALSE - Even moving from Low to Medium performer provides massive value; continuous improvement over time

True or False: DevOps only applies to software companies
FALSE - Any organization delivering value through technology can benefit (finance, healthcare, retail, government, etc.)

Name 3 benefits of DevOps for business
1. Faster time-to-market (competitive advantage)
2. Lower failure rates (reduced costs, better reliability)
3. Faster recovery (minimized downtime impact)
4. Employee satisfaction (less toil, more innovation)
5. Better customer experience (frequent improvements, quick fixes)

What is the Westrum Organizational Culture model?
Pathological (power-oriented, fear) → Bureaucratic (rule-oriented, slow) → Generative (performance-oriented, high trust)
DevOps requires Generative culture

What does "shift left" mean?
Move quality/security activities earlier in the development process (e.g., test during development, not after; security in design, not at deployment)

What is "Infrastructure as Code" (IaC)?
Managing infrastructure (servers, networks, configs) using code and version control instead of manual processes; enables repeatability and automation

What is a "deployment pipeline"?
Automated sequence of steps that take code from commit to production: Build → Test → Deploy
Also called CI/CD pipeline

What is "blue-green deployment"?
Two identical production environments (blue and green); deploy to inactive one, test, then switch traffic instantly; allows instant rollback

What is a "canary deployment"?
Deploy new version to small subset of users (5-10%) first; monitor for issues; gradually increase to 100% if healthy; roll back if problems detected

What is "feature flag" (feature toggle)?
Code switch that enables/disables features without redeploying; allows testing in production, gradual rollouts, quick rollback

Why do large batch deployments fail more often?
More changes = more complexity; harder to troubleshoot; blast radius is larger; accumulates risk; testing is harder

Give an example of "collaboration over silos"
Dev and Ops work together on same team; shared on-call rotation; joint ownership of production; cross-functional teams

What is "psychological safety" in DevOps teams?
Team members feel safe to take risks, admit mistakes, ask questions without fear of blame or punishment; essential for learning culture

What company reduced deployment time from 4 hours to 30 seconds? How?
Amazon - Automated their deployment pipeline; moved from large monolithic deployments to small microservices deployed independently

What was Etsy's key DevOps transformation?
Went from deploying twice per week (with fear and stress) to deploying 25-50 times per day with confidence through automation and culture change

Why did Netflix build Chaos Monkey?
To intentionally break production systems to test resilience; builds confidence that systems can handle failures; finds weaknesses before real incidents
