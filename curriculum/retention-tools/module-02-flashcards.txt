# Module 2: Linux & Git - Flashcards

# Linux Fundamentals

What is the root directory in Linux?
/ (forward slash) - the top of the entire filesystem tree

What does pwd command do?
Print Working Directory - shows your current location in the filesystem

What does ls -lah do?
List files in long format (-l), including hidden files (-a), with human-readable sizes (-h)

What's the difference between cd ~ and cd - ?
cd ~ goes to home directory; cd - goes to previous directory

What does chmod 755 mean?
Owner: rwx (7), Group: r-x (5), Others: r-x (5) - owner full access, others read+execute

What does chmod 644 mean?
Owner: rw- (6), Group: r-- (4), Others: r-- (4) - owner can write, others read-only

How do you make a file executable?
chmod +x filename  OR  chmod 755 filename

What's the difference between cp and mv?
cp copies (original remains), mv moves/renames (original gone)

Why is rm -rf dangerous?
Deletes recursively (-r) and forcefully (-f) without confirmation; no undo; can destroy system

What does mkdir -p do?
Creates parent directories as needed; mkdir -p /a/b/c creates all three if they don't exist

What does touch command do?
Creates empty file or updates timestamp of existing file

What's the difference between > and >> ?
> overwrites file, >> appends to file

What does | (pipe) do?
Sends output of one command as input to next command; chains commands together

What does tail -f do?
Follow mode - shows real-time updates to file; essential for watching logs

What does grep -i do?
Case-insensitive search

What does grep -r do?
Recursive search - searches through directories

What does grep -v do?
Invert match - shows lines NOT matching the pattern

What's the find command syntax for files modified in last 7 days?
find /path -name "*.log" -mtime -7

What does 2>/dev/null do?
Redirects error messages (stderr) to /dev/null (discards them)

What does wc -l do?
Word count lines - counts number of lines in file or output

What does sort | uniq -c do?
Sorts lines then counts unique occurrences

What does awk '{print $1}' do?
Prints first column/field from each line

What does sed 's/old/new/g' do?
Stream editor - replaces all occurrences of 'old' with 'new'

Why do 96% of web servers run Linux?
Free, stable, secure, automation-friendly, powers the cloud

What's the difference between Ubuntu and Alpine Linux?
Ubuntu: Full-featured, 70MB, user-friendly; Alpine: Minimal, 5MB, container-focused

What package manager does Ubuntu use?
apt (apt-get, apt install)

What package manager does CentOS use?
yum or dnf

What's the Linux philosophy?
Do one thing well; work together; handle text streams

Why is everything a file in Linux?
Uniform interface - hardware, configs, processes all accessed like files

What does sudo mean?
Super User DO - run command with admin/root privileges

# Git Fundamentals

What is Git?
Distributed version control system - tracks code changes over time

What's the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is the version control tool; GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories

What are the three states in Git?
Working Directory, Staging Area (Index), Repository (committed)

What does git init do?
Initialize new Git repository in current directory

What does git add do?
Stages changes for commit - moves files from working directory to staging area

What does git commit do?
Saves staged changes to repository with a message

What does git status show?
Current state: which files are modified, staged, untracked

What does git log show?
History of commits with author, date, message

What does git diff show?
Differences between working directory and last commit (or between commits)

What's the difference between git fetch and git pull?
fetch downloads changes but doesn't merge; pull = fetch + merge

What does git push do?
Uploads local commits to remote repository

What does git clone do?
Downloads complete copy of remote repository

What is a branch in Git?
Parallel line of development; pointer to a specific commit

What does git branch do?
Lists branches OR creates new branch (git branch name)

What does git checkout do?
Switches to different branch or commit

What does git merge do?
Combines changes from one branch into current branch

What is a merge conflict?
Occurs when same lines modified in different branches; Git can't auto-merge

How do you resolve a merge conflict?
Edit conflicting files, choose which changes to keep, git add, then git commit

What's the difference between merge and rebase?
Merge creates merge commit preserving history; rebase replays commits on top of another branch (linear history)

What is origin in Git?
Default name for remote repository you cloned from

What does git remote -v show?
Lists all remote repositories and their URLs

What is HEAD in Git?
Pointer to current commit/branch you're on

What does git stash do?
Temporarily saves uncommitted changes; useful when switching branches

What does git cherry-pick do?
Applies specific commit from one branch to another

What is .gitignore?
File listing patterns for files Git should not track (e.g., *.log, node_modules/)

Why should you never commit passwords to Git?
They remain in history forever; accessible to anyone with repo access; security risk

What makes a good commit message?
Clear, concise, describes WHY not just WHAT; present tense; <50 chars summary

What is a pull request?
Request to merge your branch into another branch; includes code review

What is GitFlow workflow?
Branching model: main (production), develop (integration), feature branches, release branches

Why use feature branches?
Isolate work; don't break main branch; enable parallel development; easier code review

What does git reset do?
Moves HEAD to different commit; can unstage or undo commits

What does git revert do?
Creates new commit that undoes previous commit; preserves history

What's the difference between git reset and git revert?
reset rewrites history (dangerous on shared branches); revert adds new commit (safe)

What does git reflog show?
History of HEAD movements; can recover "lost" commits

What is a Git hook?
Script that runs automatically at certain points (pre-commit, pre-push, etc.)

What is a detached HEAD state?
HEAD points to commit instead of branch; changes not on any branch

# Combined Application

What commands check if web server is running on Linux?
systemctl status nginx  OR  ps aux | grep nginx  OR  top

How do you view last 100 lines of nginx error log?
tail -n 100 /var/log/nginx/error.log

How do you follow nginx access log in real-time?
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log

How do you find all .conf files in /etc?
find /etc -name "*.conf"

How do you check disk space on Linux?
df -h (disk free, human-readable)

How do you check size of a directory?
du -sh /path/to/directory

How would you find top 10 largest files?
du -ah /path | sort -hr | head -10  OR  find /path -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort -hr | head -10

How do you find all error lines in all log files?
grep -r "error" /var/log/*.log  OR  find /var/log -name "*.log" -exec grep -i "error" {} +

How do you count how many processes are running?
ps aux | wc -l

How do you kill a process?
kill PID (graceful)  OR  kill -9 PID (force)
