## Troubleshooting Low Retention

### If Retention Score Drops Below 80%

**Immediate Actions**:
1. ☐ Schedule extra review session this week
2. ☐ Identify which concepts are weakest
3. ☐ Re-read those specific lessons
4. ☐ Create additional flashcards for weak areas
5. ☐ Use Feynman Technique (explain out loud)
6. ☐ Complete additional practice exercises

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- ☐ Not reviewing frequently enough (increase review frequency)
- ☐ Reviews are too passive (switch to active recall)
- ☐ Trying to memorize instead of understand (focus on "why")
- ☐ Too much information too fast (slow down new learning)
- ☐ Not enough sleep (retention solidifies during sleep!)
- ☐ Too distracted during study (eliminate distractions)
