## How to Complete This Module

### Daily Schedule (2 weeks = 14 days)

**Week 1**:
- Day 1-2: Lesson 1 + Exercise 1.1
- Day 3-4: Lesson 2 + Exercise 1.2
- Day 5-7: Lesson 3 + Reflection

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Read each lesson carefully** (don't skim!)
   - Take notes in your own words
   - Pause to think about examples
   - Relate concepts to your experience

2. **Complete exercises immediately**
   - Apply what you just learned
   - Don't skip "too easy" exercises
   - Document your thought process

3. **Take the quiz honestly**
   - No Googling during quiz (test understanding)
   - Review wrong answers, re-read lessons
   - Retake if needed (learning > score)

4. **Build the project thoughtfully**
   - This is your portfolio piece
   - Quality > speed
   - Document your decisions

5. **Submit for review**
   - Push to GitHub
   - Create pull request
   - Tag instructor

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Mistake: Rushing through theory to "get to the coding"
**WHY it's wrong**: Without understanding WHY, you're just following recipes. First problem that deviates from the recipe and you're stuck.

**✅ Instead**: Take time to understand concepts. The coding will make more sense and you'll be able to adapt.

### ❌ Mistake: "I already know this, I'll skip it"
**WHY it's wrong**: You might know WHAT DevOps is, but do you know WHY it emerged? The business drivers? The cultural aspects?

**✅ Instead**: Even if familiar, review to solidify mental models and fill gaps.

### ❌ Mistake: Passive reading without exercises
**WHY it's wrong**: Reading creates illusion of knowledge. Doing reveals gaps.

**✅ Instead**: Complete every exercise. They're designed to test understanding.

## Getting Help

### If you're confused:
1. Re-read the lesson (seriously, read it again)
2. Try the exercise anyway (failing teaches)
3. Ask specific questions (not "I don't get it" but "I don't understand why X leads to Y")
4. Tag instructor in PR with questions

Remember: **Understanding > Memorization**

The goal isn't to memorize definitions. It's to understand the problems DevOps solves, so you can apply these principles to any situation.
