      "feedback": "Perfect score here as well! Not only were your answers correct, but your explanations were exceptionally thorough and insightful. You accurately debunked common misconceptions (like automation eliminating jobs or DevOps being just about tools) and clearly articulated the reasoning behind concepts like blameless post-mortems and DORA research findings. This shows a deep conceptual understanding beyond mere memorization."

      "max": 6,
      "feedback": "Excellent work on these foundational short answer questions. \n*   **Q11 (Why DevOps emerged):** Your explanation was comprehensive, hitting all the key points: silos, slow releases, manual errors, and competitive pressure. \n*   **Q12 (Annual Deployment Cost Calculation):** You provided a crystal-clear breakdown of your work, showing each step of the calculation, and arrived at the correct answer. The additional notes on indirect costs were a brilliant touch, demonstrating practical foresight. \n*   **Q13 (Lead Time vs. Process Time):** You accurately defined both terms, highlighted the crucial role of 'wait time,' and explained its significance in identifying waste and focusing improvement efforts. \n\n(Note: Questions 14 and 15 were not explicitly assigned points in the detailed rubric structure, but your answers to them were also exemplary. They showed strong understanding of DevOps benefits and how to articulate the value proposition, which reinforces your overall mastery.)"

      "feedback": "Superb analysis of the scenario! You correctly identified Company B as 'doing DevOps' and articulated *why* with precision. Your explanation went beyond simply listing tools to emphasize the critical role of culture, shared responsibility, blameless post-mortems, and shared feedback loops.
