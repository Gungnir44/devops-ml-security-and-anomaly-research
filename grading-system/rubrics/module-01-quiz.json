          "explanation": "DevOps emerged because silos between development and operations caused slow, error-prone releases",
          "common_mistakes": [
            "A: Too narrow - not just about programming languages",
            "C: Cloud providers are a tool, not the core problem",

          "common_mistakes": [
            "B: Quarterly integration is traditional waterfall",

          "explanation": "Traditional IT typically deployed quarterly or yearly, leading to large, risky releases",
          "common_mistakes": [
            "A, B: Multiple times per day or daily is DevOps/elite performance",

          "explanation": "Toil is manual, repetitive, automatable work that doesn't add value",
          "common_mistakes": [
            "B: Not all work is toil - creative, strategic work is valuable",
            "C: Difficult work can be valuable if it's not repetitive",
            "D: Toil exists across all teams, not just operations"

          "good_answer_example": "Lead time is the total time from feature start to production deployment. Process time is only the time spent actively working (coding, testing, deploying). The difference is wait time. This matters because most lead time (often 80-90%) is spent waiting, not working, which represents waste and opportunity for improvement.",
